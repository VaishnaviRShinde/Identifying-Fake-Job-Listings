This project focuses on identifying fraudulent job listings in the digital employment market using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. Our team cleaned and structured the dataset with Generative AI models and built a Random Forest classifier to predict fake job postings. The model achieved a 96% accuracy rate, providing a scalable solution to enhance job platform security.

Technologies used: Python, Scikit-learn, BERT, TF-IDF, Random Forest, and Generative AI.
